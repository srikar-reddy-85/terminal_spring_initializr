# Spring Boot Project Generator Script

This script automates the creation of a Spring Boot project by interacting with the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) service. It allows you to select dependencies, configure project details, and download a ready-to-use Spring Boot project zip file.

## Features

- Search and select dependencies from an extensive list of available Spring Boot starters.
- Configure project settings such as `type`, `language`, `Spring Boot version`, `base directory`, `groupId`, `artifactId`, `name`, `description`, `package name`, `packaging`, and `Java version`.
- Automatically download and unzip the generated Spring Boot project.
- Remove the zip file after extraction to keep the directory clean.

## Requirements

- **cURL**: The script uses `curl` to download the project from Spring Initializr.
- **unzip**: To extract the downloaded zip file.

Ensure both `curl` and `unzip` are installed:

```
sudo apt-get install curl unzip  # For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install curl unzip      # For CentOS/RHEL
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./create-springboot-project.sh
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to:

   - Enter a search term for dependencies and choose from matching results.
   - Configure project details (type, language, version, etc.).
   - Download, extract, and clean up the Spring Boot project zip file.

### Example Session

```bash
Enter a search term for dependencies (or press Enter to finish): web
Found matching dependencies:
1. web
2. web-services
Enter the number of a dependency to add (or press Enter to continue): 1
Added: web
Enter a search term for dependencies (or press Enter to finish):
Enter the project type (default: maven-project):
Enter the programming language (default: java):
Enter Spring Boot version (default: 3.3.5):
Enter base directory (e.g., product-service): my-service
Enter groupId (e.g., com.example): com.mycompany
Enter artifactId (e.g., product-service): my-service
Enter project name (e.g., product-service): My Service
Enter project description: My Spring Boot Service
Enter package name (e.g., com.example.demo): com.mycompany.myservice
Enter packaging type (default: jar):
Enter Java version (default: 17):
Spring Boot project my-service.zip created successfully.
Unzipped to my-service/
Deleted my-service.zip.
```

### Generated URL Example

The URL generated by the script might look like this:

```
https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?type=maven-project&language=java&bootVersion=3.3.5&baseDir=my-service&groupId=com.mycompany&artifactId=my-service&name=My%20Service&description=My%20Spring%20Boot%20Service&packageName=com.mycompany.myservice&packaging=jar&javaVersion=17&dependencies=web
```

## Running the Script from Anywhere

To make the script accessible from any directory:

1. **Move the Script**  
   Move it to a directory like `~/scripts` or `/usr/local/bin`:

   ```bash
   mv create-springboot-project.sh ~/scripts/
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**  
   Grant execute permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/scripts/create-springboot-project.sh
   ```

3. **Add to PATH**  
   Open `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Add this line at the end:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:~/scripts"
   ```

   Replace `~/scripts` with the path where you stored the script. Then reload `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. **Run from Anywhere**  
   Now, you can run the script by typing:

   ```bash
   create-springboot-project.sh
   ```

### Optional: Create an Alias

For a shorter command, add an alias in your `.bashrc`:

```bash
alias create-spring='~/scripts/create-springboot-project.sh'
```

Reload `.bashrc` and use the alias:

```bash
create-spring
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing cURL or unzip**: Make sure `curl` and `unzip` are installed. Run `sudo apt install curl unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu or `sudo yum install curl unzip` on CentOS/RHEL.
- **Invalid Choices**: If you select an invalid dependency number, re-enter a valid number as prompted.
